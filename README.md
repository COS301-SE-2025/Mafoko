## Project Description
**Marito** is a progressive web application (PWA) developed for the COS 301 Capstone project at the University of Pretoria. It serves as a unified platform for accessing, browsing, and contributing to multilingual glossaries, dictionaries, and terminology banks. Designed with an offline-first approach and scalable architecture, Marito aims to support South Africaâ€™s low-resource languages and empower linguistic research, NLP development, and language preservation.

## Git Structure & Branching Strategy

#### **Repository Type**: Monorepo
#### **Structure**:

```
/frontend       â†’ React + TypeScript UI  
/backend        â†’ Python FastAPI backend  
/Documentation  â†’ Design and documentation  
/.github        â†’ GitHub Actions workflows and configuration  
```

#### **GitFlow Branching Model**
  * `main` â€“ Stable, production-ready code
  * `develop` â€“ Active development integration branch
  * `feature/*` â€“ New features and enhancements
  * `release/*` â€“ Pre-release testing and stabilization
  * `hotfix/*` â€“ Critical fixes applied directly to production

This structure ensures clean separation between environments, supports parallel feature development, and maintains a stable deployment process. All code changes are merged into `develop` through pull requests, and releases are carefully tested before merging into `main`.
