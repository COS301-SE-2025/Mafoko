### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (preferably using nvm)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- **Git CLI** (donâ€™t use VS Code GUI to commit beacause Husky won't trigger)

### Initial Setup
Run this after cloning the repo. Only for the first time after you clone.

First make sure you `cd frontend` and `npm i`

**From the root** of the repo execute the following:
```bash
git config core.hooksPath .husky
chmod +x .husky/*
```
