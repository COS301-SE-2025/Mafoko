# User Story #2: UpVote System

**ID:** US002 (Mavito Project)  
**Title:** Crowdsourced Validation via UpVoting  

**As a:** Mavito application user (e.g., language enthusiast, linguist, or researcher) who wants to contribute to the accuracy and quality of lexicon entries,  
**I want:** to upvote (or downvote) suggested changes or comments on terms in the lexicon,  
**So that:** the community can collectively validate contributions, and moderators can prioritize high-quality updates for integration into the central repository.
