# User Story : Responsive Design


**Title:** Responsive Layout for Mobile and Desktop Devices

**As a:** As a user who may need to access the Mavito application while on the go,

**I want:** the user-interface to adapt and remain fully functional on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops,

**So that:**  I can quickly and seamlessly use the application in any situation, regardless of the device I'm using.

## Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **Mobile Adaptability:**
    * **Given**  I am using the Mavito application,
    * **And** I am on a mobile device,
    * **Then** the layout should automatically adjust to fit the screen without horizontal scrolling.

2.  **Touch-Friendly UI:**
    * **Given** I am interacting with the app on a touchscreen device,
    * **And** I tap on any button or link.
    * **Then** The tapped element should be responsive to touch and have a minimum tap area of 48px Ã— 48px.

3.  **Touchscreen Swiping and Scrolling Support:**
    * **Given** I am using the Mavito app on a touchscreen device,
    * **And** I am viewing content that extends beyond the initial screen (e.g., a list or feed).
    * **Then** I should be able to scroll vertically or horizontally (depending on the content) using swipe gestures,
    * **And** the scrolling should be smooth, responsive.

4. **Adaptive Mobile Navigation Elements:**
   * **Given** I am using the Mavito app on a mobile device,
   * **Then** the navigation should adapt to a mobile-friendly layout.
   * #### For example: display a hamburger menu instead of a full-width navigation bar.

5.  **Device Orientation Handling:**
    * **Given** I am using the app on a mobile device,
    * **And** I switch between portrait and landscape mode,
    * **Then** the UI layout should follow without breaking or cutting off content.

6.  **Mobile Hardware and OS Compatibility:**
    * **Given** I am using the Mavito app on a mobile device running a supported operating system version (e.g., Android 10+, iOS 13+),
    * **And** the device has at least 2 GB of RAM and a modern mobile browser (e.g. Chrome),
    * **Then** all core features should work smoothly without crashes or performance lags.

7.  **Error Handling - Network Errors (mobile use):**
    * **Given** I lose internet connectivity due to a poor signal while using the app,
    * **Then** the application should seamlessly switch to its offline version without interruption,
    * **And** provide an indication informing me that the app is currently in its offline mode

**Notes/Assumptions:**

* Devices with screen widths less than or equal to 768 pixels are considered mobile, and touch interation is expected on these devices.
