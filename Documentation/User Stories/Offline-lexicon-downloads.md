# User Story #2: Download Language Resources for Offline Access

**ID:** US002 (Mavito Project)

**Title:** Download Select Language Resources for Offline Use

**As a:** Mavito application user (e.g., language enthusiast, NLP researcher, student),

**I want:** to be able to select and download specific language resources (like individual lexicons, glossaries, or dictionaries) to my device,

**So that:** I can access and use this information even when I do not have an active internet connection.

---

## Acceptance Criteria:

1.  **Discover and Select Resources for Download:**
    * **Given** I am browsing the available language resources within the application (while online),
    * **Then** I can clearly identify which resources are available for download.
    * **And** I can select one or more language resources to download.
    * **And** the application shows the estimated size of the selected resource(s) before initiating the download.

2.  **Initiate Download:**
    * **Given** I have selected one or more language resources for download,
    * **Then** I can initiate the download process with a clear action (e.g., a "Download" button).

3.  **Download Process Feedback:**
    * **Given** a download is in progress,
    * **Then** the application provides clear visual feedback on the download status (e.g., progress bar, percentage complete, estimated time remaining).
    * **And** I can continue to use other online features of the application while a download is in progress (background download).
    * **And** I have the option to pause and resume a download if needed.
    * **And** I have the option to cancel an ongoing download.

4.  **Successful Download and Storage:**
    * **Given** a language resource download completes successfully,
    * **Then** the application notifies me that the download is complete.
    * **And** the downloaded resource is stored locally on my device in a way that the Mavito application can access it offline.
    * **And** the application clearly indicates which resources have been successfully downloaded and are available offline.

5.  **Managing Downloaded Resources:**
    * **Given** I have downloaded language resources,
    * **Then** I can view a list of all my downloaded resources within the application.
    * **And** I can remove/delete downloaded resources from my device to free up storage space.
    * **And** the application shows the amount of local storage space currently used by downloaded Mavito resources.

6.  **Error Handling - Insufficient Storage:**
    * **Given** I attempt to download a resource,
    * **And** my device has insufficient storage space,
    * **Then** the application informs me of the insufficient storage and the download does not proceed (or pauses until space is freed).

7.  **Error Handling - Interrupted Connection During Download:**
    * **Given** a download is in progress and my internet connection is lost,
    * **Then** the application gracefully pauses the download process.
    * **And** I am notified of the interruption.
    * **And** the application attempts to resume the download automatically when the connection is re-established, or allows me to manually resume.

8.  **Error Handling - Download Failure:**
    * **Given** a download fails for reasons other than connection loss or insufficient storage (e.g., server error, corrupted file),
    * **Then** the application notifies me of the failure and provides a reason if possible.
    * **And** I have the option to retry the download.

9.  **Accessing Downloaded Resources Offline:**
    * **(This links to another user story about offline access, but is an implicit outcome)**
    * **Given** I have successfully downloaded a language resource,
    * **And** I am offline,
    * **Then** I can access and use that downloaded resource within the Mavito application.

---

**Notes/Assumptions:**

* The user must be online to browse and initiate downloads.
* The application will need appropriate permissions to write to local device storage.
* The format of the downloaded data should be optimized for offline use and efficient storage.
* This user story focuses on the *download* functionality. A separate user story would cover the specifics of *accessing and using* the data offline (e.g., offline search within downloaded resources).
