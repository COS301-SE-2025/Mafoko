# User Story #4: Multilingual Interface Support

**ID:** US004 (Mavito Project)

**Title:** Support for Multiple Languages in User Interface

**As a:** Mavito application user (e.g., language enthusiast, NLP researcher, student) who speaks one of South Africa's 12 official languages,

**I want:** the application interface to be available in my preferred language,

**So that:** I can navigate and interact with the app comfortably without language barriers.

---

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Language Selection:**
   - [ ] **Given** I open the Mavito application for the first time,
   - [ ] **Then** the app prompts me to select my preferred language from a list of supported languages (e.g., isiZulu, Afrikaans, English, etc.).
   - [ ] **And** the selected language is saved as my default for future sessions.

2. **Dynamic Language Switching:**
   - [ ] **Given** I am using the app in my default language,
   - [ ] **And** I navigate to the settings menu,
   - [ ] **Then** I can switch to another supported language at any time.
   - [ ] **And** the interface updates immediately to reflect the new language choice.

3. **Localized Content Display:**
   - [ ] **Given** I have selected a non-English language (e.g., Sesotho),
   - [ ] **Then** all menus, buttons, labels, and system messages are displayed in the chosen language.
   - [ ] **And** the app respects right-to-left (RTL) or other language-specific formatting if applicable.

4. **Fallback for Untranslated Content:**
   - [ ] **Given** a piece of text has not been translated into my selected language,
   - [ ] **Then** the app displays the English version as a fallback.
   - [ ] **And** logs the missing translation for future localization efforts.

5. **Offline Language Support:**
   - [ ] **Given** I am offline,
   - [ ] **Then** the app retains my language preferences and displays all available localized content without requiring an internet connection.

6. **User Contribution to Translations (Optional Enhancement):**
   - [ ] **Given** I notice a missing or incorrect translation,
   - [ ] **Then** I can submit a suggested correction or addition via a dedicated feedback option.
   - [ ] **And** the suggestion is sent to the central repository for moderation and inclusion.

### Notes/Assumptions:

- This user story assumes that translations for supported languages will be stored in a centralized repository and downloaded as part of the lexicon data sync process (aligned with US001).
- Initial implementation may focus on a subset of high-priority languages, with others added incrementally.
- RTL support is out of scope for the initial version but could be added later for languages like Arabic if needed.
- The app's core functionality (e.g., search, data display) remains unchanged regardless of the selected interface language.
