# FeedbackHub User Stories

## User Story #12: Submit Feedback
**ID:** US001 (FeedbackHub Project)  
**Title:** Multi-Category Feedback Submission

**As a:** Application user (customer, stakeholder, or end-user) who wants to communicate with the organization about their experience,

**I want:** to submit feedback through different categories (suggestions, complaints, or compliments) with optional contact information,

**So that:** the organization can understand my needs, address issues, and improve their services based on user input.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Category Selection:**
   - Given I am on the feedback submission page,
   - Then I can choose between three feedback types: Suggestion, Complaint, or Compliment.
   - And each category has distinct visual indicators (icons and colors).

2. **Form Completion:**
   - Given I have selected a feedback category,
   - When I fill out the feedback form,
   - Then I can optionally provide my name and email address.
   - And I must provide a message describing my feedback (required field).

3. **Contextual Guidance:**
   - Given I select a specific feedback type,
   - Then the form updates with appropriate placeholder text and messaging.
   - And the submit button reflects the selected category.

4. **Form Validation:**
   - Given I attempt to submit feedback,
   - When the required message field is empty,
   - Then the submit button remains disabled.
   - And form validation prevents submission until requirements are met.

5. **Submission Confirmation:**
   - Given I successfully submit feedback,
   - Then I receive immediate visual confirmation of submission.
   - And the form resets after a brief thank you message.

6. **Anonymous Submissions:**
   - Given I choose not to provide contact information,
   - Then my feedback is still accepted and processed.
   - And my submission is marked as "Anonymous" in the system.

### Notes/Assumptions:
- All feedback types use the same form structure for consistency  
- Contact information is optional to encourage participation  
- System logs all submissions with timestamps  
- Future enhancements could include file attachments

## User Story #13: Admin Dashboard Management
**ID:** US002 (FeedbackHub Project)  
**Title:** Comprehensive Feedback Administration

**As a:** System administrator who needs to monitor and respond to user feedback,

**I want:** to view, filter, search, and manage all submitted feedback through a centralized dashboard,

**So that:** I can efficiently track feedback trends, prioritize responses, and ensure all user concerns are addressed appropriately.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Dashboard Overview:**
   - Given I access the admin dashboard,
   - Then I see summary statistics for total feedback, pending items, in-progress items, and resolved items.
   - And statistics include trend indicators showing changes over time.

2. **Feedback Listing:**
   - Given I am viewing the feedback list,
   - Then each item displays type, status, priority, user information, and submission date.
   - And items are color-coded by category and status for quick visual identification.

3. **Filtering Capabilities:**
   - Given I want to focus on specific feedback,
   - When I use the filter controls,
   - Then I can filter by feedback type (all, suggestions, complaints, compliments).
   - And I can filter by status (all, pending, in-progress, resolved).

4. **Search Functionality:**
   - Given I need to find specific feedback,
   - When I use the search bar,
   - Then the system searches across feedback content, user names, and email addresses.
   - And results update in real-time as I type.

5. **Detail Management:**
   - Given I click on a feedback item,
   - Then I see full details in a dedicated panel.
   - And I can update the status using a dropdown menu.
   - And changes are immediately reflected in the system.

6. **Status Workflow:**
   - Given I am managing feedback items,
   - Then I can move items through the workflow: Pending → In Progress → Resolved.
   - And status changes are tracked with timestamps.

### Notes/Assumptions:
- Admin access requires authentication and appropriate permissions  
- All actions are logged for audit purposes  
- System supports real-time updates when multiple admins are working  
- Future enhancements could include automated assignment
