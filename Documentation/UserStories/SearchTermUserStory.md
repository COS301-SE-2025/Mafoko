# User Story #1: Search Feature

**ID:** US001 (Mavito Project)
**Title:** Multilingual Term Search
**As a** Mavito application user (eg., casual user, linguist, or contributer),
**I want:** to search across multiple multilingual glossaries and dictionaries using filters and smart suggestions,
**So that:** I can quickly find definitions, translations, and related entries in my preferred language.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Query Input:**
    - **Given** I am on the main search page,
    - **When** I enter a query into the search bar,
    - **Then** the system searches across all selected data sources and returns matching terms.

2. **Filter Options:**
    - **Given** I want to refine my search,
    - **Then** I can apply filters like language, part of speech, or glossary type before or after submitting the query.

3. **Fuzzy Search (Optional):**
    - **Given** my query has a typo or partial match,
    - **Then** the system offers similar results using fuzzy matching.
4. **AI-Powered Suggestions (Optional):**
    - **Given** I start typing in the search bar,
    - **Then** I see AI-generated autocomplete suggestions based on common terms or semantic matches.

5. **Search History:**
    - **Given** I have searched for terms in the past,
    - **Then** the system shows my recent queries and allows re-searching them.

6. **Sorting and Result Presentation:**
    - **Given** the results are displayed,
    - **Then** I can sort them by relevance, alphabetical order, or popularity,
    - **And** each result shows the term, language, and a brief definition snippit.

## Assumptions
- Offline support will allow previously downloaded glossaries to be searched.
- Filters and sort options persist across sessions.
- AI and fuzzy search are optional enhancements.
- Glossary datasets are already available and preloaded or fetched via sync.
